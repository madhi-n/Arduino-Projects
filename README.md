# Arduino-Projects
Some programs that I made in TEJ3M0, and other programs I made in my free time

Hey! Feel free to check out the programs I made specifically for the Arduino Uno Microprocessor, which does alot of neat stuff.
Some of my featured projects include a Arduino-powered RC car that can be controlled with your voice on your smartphone.
